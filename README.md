As part of learning Head First Design Patterns book's in DANA, here it is the Strategy Pattern.

The best way to patterns is to load your brain with them and then recognize places in your designs and existing applications where you can apply them. Instead of code reuse, with patterns you get experience reuse.
No matter how well you design an application, over time an application must grow and change or it will die.

The Strategy Pattern itself defines as a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from a client that uses it.

<p>There are some object oriented principles of this pattern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encapsulate what varies.</li>
  <li>Favor composition over inheritence.</li>
  <li>Program to interfaces , not implementations.</li>
</ul>
